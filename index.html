<h2> Education </h2>
   <p>
    "I am the stone that the builder refused
    I am the visual, the inspiration
    That made Lady sing the blues
    
    I'm the spark that makes your idea bright
    The same spark that lights the dark
    So that you can know your left from your right
    
    I am the ballot in your box, the bullet in the gun
    The inner glow that lets you know to call your brother son
    The story that just begun, the promise of what's to come
    And I'mma remain a soldier till the war is won" - Boondocks</p>
