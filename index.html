                Summary 
            </h2>
            <p> 
                As a veteran of 5 years who has served honorably, I strive to continue that service through my professional
                civillian career. I have leadership training. I've worked in the federal government as a police officer. I have
                worked independently as a property manager and am enrolled as a student to finish my degree in communication. My
                goal is to continue growing my career in tech while I start a family.
