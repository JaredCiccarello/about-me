<!-- Create an About Me guessing game that utilizes HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.

Include on your HTML page a short biography, your education history, an overview of your job experience, and any goals that you may have. -->

<!-- Prompt the user a total of exactly five yes or no questions. The user input for the answer must accept either y/n or yes/no responses while taking into consideration case sensitivity by normalizing the user input so that it can be validated (hint: look into the .toUpperCase() or .toLowerCase() functions). Be sure to let the user know if they answered the question correctly by alerting them with a response.

Add console.log() messages within your app to notify the user if they are correct. Before submitting, comment out (donâ€™t delete) your console.log() messages and replace them with the alerts() to complete the project. -->

   <h4>
    "I am the stone that the builder refused
    I am the visual, the inspiration
    That made Lady sing the blues
    
    I'm the spark that makes your idea bright
    The same spark that lights the dark
    So that you can know your left from your right
    
    I am the ballot in your box, the bullet in the gun
    The inner glow that lets you know to call your brother son
    The story that just begun, the promise of what's to come
    And I'mma remain a soldier till the war is won" - Boondocks</h4>
