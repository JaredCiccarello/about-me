# about-me

The README document is the first point of entry into a code project, and the fundamental source of documentation. When viewing a project on GitHub, the README appears on the entry page immediately beneath the list of files and directories in the project. You will learn in the coming months that working with code with poor documentation can be a pain, so strive to provide good documentation for your work! -->

What kind of content should be in the README?

General project information (what does it do, who wrote it, who collaborated, which tools are used)
Instructions for installation and use
Information on the license
Acknowledgements, etc.

Also take a look at the following suggested structures. Note the similarities and differences; there is no absolute right/wrong approach. Consider the information that would be helpful to users of your project, and then set one up that is appropriate to your project:

Stack Overflow Q/A on “How to write a good README” (reprint)
A Beginner’s Guide to Writing a Kick*ss README

Lastly, remember to keep your README up to date! Don’t just create it and then neglect it!

README files are written in a language called Markdown.
